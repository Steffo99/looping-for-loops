## About

Loopy the cat wandered to a fruity loops factory, and there he ate so much that he got stuck in a giant fruit loop!

Now he wants to go back home, but the exit is on a looping conveyor belt with buttons, pistons, lasers, and buzzsaws!  
_(Why are there death traps in a factory?)_

Complete **platforming challenges** to collect **loops**, and get to the exit with the most loops possible!
